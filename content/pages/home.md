Joshua Pavlacky is a landscape designer, artist, and curator based in Portland Oregon. Drawing on generations of family horticultural knowledge and a refined sense of composition and materials, Joshua creates planted environments that balance beauty with ecological function. \
\
His designs begin with plants to structure the site and define a vision. Plants are selected based on the capacity of local ecosystems, their progression through changing seasons, and their sensory richness. Hardscaping follows, establishing a comfortable interface between plantings and functional space. Growing into themselves, his gardens become habitats that are both wild and intimate.\
\
Joshua is fascinated by the ways that non-human life permeates built environments. Collaboration with this irrepressible force is at the core of his work.\
