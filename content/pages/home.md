Drawing on generations of family horticultural knowledge and his background as an artist and curator, Joshua Pavlacky creates planted environments that balance beauty with ecological function. Measured in acreage or square feet, Joshua’s gardens are spaces for people to explore, create, and connect.\
\
Joshua works closely with his clients to discover their functional needs and desires for an outdoor space. His designs begin with plants, which structure the site and create mood. Plants are selected based on the needs and capacities of local ecosystems, their formal progression through changing seasons, and sheer sensory richness. Hardscaping follows, establishing a comfortable interface between plantscapes and daily use.\
\
Continuously evolving, Joshua’s landscapes are never truly finished. They welcome change and intervention, becoming habitats that are both wild and intimate.
