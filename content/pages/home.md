Deep Earth is a landscape design studio located in Portland, OR, and New York, NY. Designing with an eye towards environmental rejuvenation and climate adaptation, Deep Earth collaborates with artists and biologists to create ethical and educational plantscapes.

Our designs begin with plants, weaving together the needs of our clients and the needs of local ecosystems.

We create spaces for their beauty and to serve as a vital refuge for urban and suburban wildlife. Deep Earth specializes in cultivating habitats; choosing plants that attract pollinators and creating environments for animal and bird life to thrive.

Seasonal gardens provide year round interest. Xeric gardens are adapted to dry, water-scarce sites. Eco-lawns reduce maintenance and eliminate the need for chemicals. Permaculture practices such as berms and swales are a favorite of ours for retaining water.
