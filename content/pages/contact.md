ABOUT:\
\
Gifted a plot in his mother’s garden at the age of 10, Joshua has followed his love of gardening for almost 30 years. As a teenager, his first job was with a local nursery, his next as a landscaper, and then as a residential contractor. \
\
Following these experiences, he moved to New York City and was hired as a landscape technician for Zone6 Design, where he tended gardens for notable clients such as the IMG and Ford Model Agencies. Moving into the design-build field, he joined the team of Brook Landscape and honed his understanding of hardscaping and installation practices. Joshua was then hired to assist in the production of public artworks for Friends of the Highline. Working in one of the greatest gardens in New York, he was inspired to pursue his own design practice

Having studied Fine Art at Wesleyan University, Joshua concurrently pursued his interest in art and curation. He co-founded American Medium, an art gallery that ran from 2013-2019 in New York City, and focused on emerging trends in contemporary art. \
\
As a curator, Joshua has produced social spaces and exhibitions for organizations such as Bloomberg at the Venice Biennale, Rough Trade Records, Rhizome at the New Museum, Kunstverein fur die Rheinlande und Westfalen, the South African National Arts Festival and more. His exhibitions and productions have been featured in publications such as The New York Times, Artforum, Pin-Up Magazine, Art in America, and Art21.\
