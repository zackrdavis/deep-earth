‘Wild and unkempt’ was the client’s request for this recessed patio and rock garden. A canopy of passion vine and a backdrop of Phormium transitions into a xeric mixture of grasses, romneya, and arbutus. Carefully placed boulders contain the newly risen berms, and provide a natural place to sit. Grasses are left loose to drift. Vegetables are tucked in between daylilies and evening primrose. A pomegranate gives an elegant structure to the ephemeral. Hectic but cozy, the garden provides beauty and comfort throughout the year.
