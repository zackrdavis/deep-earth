The goal was usability, as muddy grass and uneven cobblestone made the existing backyard almost treacherous. The addition of bluestone pavers helped to smooth out these wrinkles, while still being framed by the details of the original stonework we preserved. Old charm meets new functionality. Hollyhock, verbena and artemisia were planted. Paired with boxwoods and an established wisteria, the garden floats between formal and casual. Elsewhere in the yard, a raised wooden platform is constructed around a mature tree, creating a modern playscape for the kids to play in, while the adults lounge in style.
