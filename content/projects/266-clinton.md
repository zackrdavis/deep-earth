After 30 years in their Clinton Hill compound, our clients were looking to radically restructure an uninspired courtyard into a space for hosting fundraisers, weddings, and dinner parties. We created a garden lush with texture and pendulous movements - always something to enjoy while waiting for guests to arrive. Busy Brooklynites are transfixed by the contrast from the street, as monarch butterflies drop in for a drink and 8-foot alliums bob in the wind. An abundance of pollinators and flying insects give the space a buzzing energy. Big blooms, just enough lawn, and a bit of formality stoke anticipation for the next gathering.
