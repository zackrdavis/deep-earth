A unique project and experience alike, this garden was built over the first three months of the COVID quarantine. Isolated in the woods of Upstate New York, a fallen tree on this 5-acre property provided a skeleton for the slow accumulation of rocks pulled from the crumbling colonial walls that slither through the site. Planters and rockeries emerged in slow motion–each stone and log carried by hand from the woods. Wandering through the trees, amongst a landscape defined rock by rock over a century ago, we reflect on the strange frozenness of time in one of the strangest of times.
