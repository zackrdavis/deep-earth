A unique project and experience alike, this garden was built over the first three months of the COVID quarantine. Isolated in the woods of Upstate New York, a fallen tree on this 5-acre property provided a skeleton for the slow accumulation of rocks pulled from the crumbling colonial walls that slither through the site. Planters and rockeries emerged in slow motion - each stone and log carried by hand from the woods. Wandering through the trees, amongst a landscape defined rock by rock over a century ago, we reflect on the strange frozenness of time in one of the strangest of times.
