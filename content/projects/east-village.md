All about the view, this rooftop garden in the East Village frames the city skyline while creating an intimate space to entertain. Cedar planters with built-in seats host eight around a pull-out table. In the corner, a custom-built lounger is the ideal spot to sunbathe amidst billowing white gaura and velvety lamb’s ear. The retractable canopy provides daytime shade in the balmy heat of summer, and opens to reveal the city lights at night. Taking advantage of the penthouse breeze, we make use of plants that gently wisp and blow to create a serene oasis from the hustle and bustle below.
