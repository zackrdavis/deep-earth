An artist’s flight from New York landed them amongst the derelit roses and brambles of this early mid-century home. Saved by the love of a new owner, the threat of development put aside, we set about to reinvigorate the landscape. Ancient roses met new rose friends, old peonies were tucked in by new perennials, and expressionist waves of willow and spirea sprouted a new backbone to support the garden’s lonely remnants. The rolling hills and flags of the golf course inspired an almost patriotic sense of color, expressionistic and saturated to compete with the scale of view. Reds shift from purples to maroon to a crimson lipstick depending on the temper of the day. Wandering around to the other side of the house, shadier moments are framed by the traditional forms of rhododendrons and azalea, under which we tucked in crawling greens, vibrant ferns, and moments of foliage that are lost in  grander spaces.
