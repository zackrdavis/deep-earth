Their baby was due any day, and the clients wanted to transform their empty yard into a lush meadow in celebration of life. Constrained by the timing of germination (for both baby and garden) we quickly cleared a swath of lawn, and amended the soil to prepare the site. Perennial grasses were planted throughout to provide structure and height, and annual wildflowers were sown abundantly to fill the gaps. A garden is always a touchstone of time. Isadora Bee arrived mid-fall. By summertime, the meadow was in full bloom, and the baby pictures filled with flowers. She and the garden continue to grow together.
