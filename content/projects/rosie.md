This brownstone needed a lot of work, but with the anticipation of a home extension in the coming years, the only thing that was reliably permanent was the fencing. For the rest of the yard, we salvaged existing step stones for a quick patio, laid some gravel and tossed down a turf rug. Fabric pots with bright yellow and orange flowers were used to add a vibrance to a space surrounded in muted tones. We refashioned window grates into trellises with vining clematis to break the monotony of the unadorned concrete walls, and paired them with the client’s own metal garden decor for detail and charm. Simple and modular, the garden is always open to change without sacrificing effect.
