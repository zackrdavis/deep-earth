Landscape design portfolio of Joshua Pavlacky, designed by Rebecca Friedman.

The main job of this website is to let Joshua's designs speak for themselves via photos.

But the [explore page](https://joshuapavlacky.com/explore) turns out to have a special use: when consulting with clients, Joshua can quickly browse for his favorite plants and surface photos of them in various contexts.
